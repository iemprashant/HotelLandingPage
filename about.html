                <h1><span class="text-primary">About</span> Oberoi Hotel </h1>
                <p>The company currently manages 33 hotels under the luxury brand Oberoi Hotels & Resorts, with a further 10 five-star properties under the Trident Hotels brand. The group also operates the Clarke's in Shimla and the Maidens Hotel, Delhi.<br> However, these two properties are not held under the Trident or under the Oberoi brand. The Clarke's, after remaining temporarily shut following its lawns caving in because of construction in the eco-sensitive vicinity, reopened on 16 September 2012.</p>

                <p>The team here is incredibly supportive and accommodating. I organized a meeting at The Oberoi Mumbai with 25 senior leaders from across the world. We held our meetings and stayed in the hotel, and were very pleased with the entire staff. They also helped organize cultural events (tours, dinners) which we needed to do while there. Highly recommend!</p>
